Register for WRITE ON! on Saturday, October 19, 2024 from 2:00pm to 4:00pm
at 1412 Jefferson Avenue. 

**Event information:**
On October 19th at 2pm, members from the Justice for Geraldine and Martin Campaign will collaborate with Kind Fools for an event titled “WRITE ON!: Imagining 1412 Jefferson Avenue.” Participants will gather in a circle for a check-in and brief body-awareness meditation, followed by hearing a poem connected to imagining 1412 Jefferson Avenue., which is the site of the former Afro Asian Book Shop owned by Martin Sostre. Participants will be invited to write on how this unused space may be used for the neighborhood’s benefit, how we may incorporate neighborhood voices, our individual and collective roles in doing so, and how we may organize in the spirit of the Afro Asian Book Shop. Participants will be encouraged (though not required) to share portions of their writing and to use this to foster collective understanding and a way forward for just and equitable community building in the Cold Springs neighborhood. This event is free and open to all participants.
