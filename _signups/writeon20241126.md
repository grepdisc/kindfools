Register for WRITE ON! on Tuesday November 26th at 6:00pm to 9:00pm
at Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo (UUCB) at 695 Elmwood Ave,
Buffalo, NY 14222. Everyone is welcome.

Our lead facilitator, Hy Carrel, will be joined by Kristine Hill, a member of the Beaver Clan of the Tuscarora Nation and the founder of [Collective Wisdoms](http://collectivewisdoms.org/). The topic for this intuitive writing workshop will be *gratitude,* indigenous perspectives on Thanksgiving, and opportunities to reflect on the holiday season, which may bring up varied feelings within us.
