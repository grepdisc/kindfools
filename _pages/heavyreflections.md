# "Heavy" Reflections is a collaborative project for the Spring of 2024

This project is supported by Just Buffalo Literary Center as part
of their Civil Writes Project in concert with their BABEL Series
featuring author [Kiese Laymon](https://www.kieselaymon.com), his memoir
*Heavy: An American Memoir* and his [BABEL
discussion](https://www.justbuffalo.org/events/babel-kiese-laymon-2024-04-25/)
on Thursday, April 25, 2024.

The goal of this project is to provide community members a continuing
opportunity to reflect deeply on their personal experiences and on how
they relate to Kiese Laymon’s memoir and BABEL discussion.
