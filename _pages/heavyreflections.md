# "Heavy" Reflections is a proposed project for the Spring of 2024

This project could be supported by Just Buffalo Literary Center as part
of their Civil Writes Project in concert with their BABEL Series
featuring author [Kiese Laymon](https://www.kieselaymon.com), his memoir
*Heavy: An American Memoir* and his [BABEL
discussion](https://www.justbuffalo.org/events/babel-kiese-laymon-2024-04-25/)
on April 24, 2024.

The goal of this project is to provide community members a continuing
opportunity to reflect deeply on their personal experiences and on how
they relate to Kiese Laymon’s memoir and BABEL discussion.

Together, we will read and discuss Heavy.<br>
Together, we will attend Kiese Laymon's BABEL discussion.<br>
Together, we write our truth as it connects with his work.<br>
Together, we will present our work and celebrate this experience.<br>

*Heavy: An American Memoir* is available from local bookstores such as [Talking Leaves](https://www.tleavesbooks.com/search/site/heavy),
[Fitz Books](https://www.fitzbooks.net) and [Zawadi Books](https://www.facebook.com/zawadibooksbflo/).
