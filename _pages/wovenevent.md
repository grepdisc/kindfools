# The Woven Event: Tell, Write, Share Monday, February 19, 2024

We gather for a special event on February 19, 2024 at 6:00pm until 9:00pm at Inspiration Point located at 483 Elmwood Avenue, Buffalo, NY 14222.

**The Woven Event** is a collaboration by the facilitators of 3 local poetry workshops to provide a single experience building on each of their strengths

- **Tell** - for the first 45 minutes Samuel Floyd will facilitate Recovery Stories
- **Write** - after a break, Hy Carrel will guide us through a WRITE ON!-style writing exercise
- **Share** - after another break, Joel Lesses will facilitate spontaneous
  discussion through the lens of poetry in the 'no mic, no list, no podium' format.

About the programs

  for sharing poetry and stories of recovery.

  is true for us in this moment.
