# The Woven Event: Tell, Write, Share - Monday May 20, 2024


**The Woven Event** is a collaboration by the facilitators of 3 local poetry workshops to provide a single experience building on each of their strengths

- **Tell** - for the first 45 minutes Samuel Floyd will facilitate Recovery Stories
- **Write** - after a break, Hy Carrel will guide us through a WRITE ON!-style writing exercise
- **Share** - after another break, Joel Lesses will facilitate spontaneous
  discussion through the lens of poetry in the 'no mic, no list, no podium' format.

About the programs

  WRITE ON! are intuitive writing workshops where we write what
  is true for us in this moment.
