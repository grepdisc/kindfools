## Kind Fools' Vision

**Expressing out truth, and having it listened to, heals us.**

## Kinds Fools' Mission Statement

We feel the healing power of being present, we affirm the inherent worth in each person, and we grow through reflective action.

Recognizing each human as unbroken, we are a welcoming community of creativity, experiential learning, listening, speaking our truth, and accompanying each other. 

We seek to become aware of our judgements and to break down the filters and stories that separate us from our siblings, valuing the wisdom of persons surviving oppressions and poverty. 

We find our purpose on the streets and through what we have experienced, inspiring kind service in solidarity with our communities.
