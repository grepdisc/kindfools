# The Moral Imperative is a collaborative project for the Spring of 2025

This project is supported by Just Buffalo Literary Center as part
of their Civil Writes Project in concert with their BABEL Series
featuring author [James McBride](http://www.jamesmcbride.com), his book
[*The Good Lord Bird*](http://www.jamesmcbride.com/good-lord-bird/) and his [BABEL
discussion](https://www.justbuffalo.org/events/babel-james-mcbride-2025-04-30/)
on Thursday, April 30, 2025.

Together, we read and discuss *The Good Lord Bird* and *Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community*.<br>
Together, we attend James McBrides's BABEL discussion.<br>
Together, we write our truth as it connects with these works and specifically when we have felt a moral imperative.<br>
Together, we present our work and celebrate this experience.<br>

Community Canvases' **The Moral Imperative:** We invite community members to read James McBride's "The Good Lord Bird" about John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. We are reading Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?" In April, we participate in a book discussion and then attend James McBride's BABEL talk. In May, we will participate in Kind Fools' WRITE ON workshops to write reflections on when we have felt a moral imperative, when we have felt called by our values and conscience to take an action. In June, we will submit our poems and reflections for publication in a book. This project is organized by Kamau R.E. Fields, Hy Carrel, Samuel Floyd, and Chanda O'Donnell de Ramirez in collaboration with Just Buffalo Literary Center's Civil Writes Project, Buffalo Latino Village Press, and Vilardo Printing.

The goal of this project is to provide community members a continuing
opportunity to reflect deeply on their personal experiences and on how
they relate to the topics in these books and this BABEL discussion.
