Kind Conversations comes out of trainings throughout 2023 led by Resetting the Table.

A community-based free workshop offering communication skill-building for healthy charged conversations in WNY and a forum for dialogue across disagreement.
 
Participants will exchange views and personal experiences, surface differences and commonalities, and practice communication skills for addressing differences directly and constructively. Together we build community capacity to explore disagreements while strengthening relationships, trust, understanding,
learning, and collaboration.
