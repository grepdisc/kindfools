## Our story 

WRITE ON! is a writing workshop created by Robert-Harry Rovin. Through participating weekly from 2016 through 2019, Kind Fools founder Hy Carrel learned to think of himself as a writer and even a [poet](https://withkindness.org). It is our pleasure to be able to offer this writing workshop to the Buffalo community and virtually.

## What is WRITE ON! ?

WRITE ON! is a process of accessing what is **your truth** in this moment, and expressing it. First, we establish a trusting container by sitting in a circle and giving each person an opportunity to "show up" and check-in. Second, we participate in a body awareness meditation, to pay attention and listen to what is true for each part of ourselves in this moment. Third, we listen to an inspiring poem. Fourth, we free-write, getting out of our heads and trusting that we will know what needs to be written in this moment. 

A key feature of WRITE ON! is how we respond to each others' writing. After our second free-write, we have a break. Then we are each invited to read one of our two writings. After reading, people are invited to respond if they wish. We ask that each response be purely encouraging and only positive. There are other opportunities for feedback and criticsm, and we set the intention that WRITE ON! is a "safe space" of purely positive and authentic responses to what others trust us by sharing.

## Description

* check-in circle
* body awareness meditation
* 1st free write
* check-in
* 2nd free write
* break
* share your writing and receive only positive reflections
