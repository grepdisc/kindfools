For our third and sixth workshops, we met online. 

These workshops served as a convenient way for people around Buffalo and even around the country to write together. We did not know that the workshop would result in friendships among disability-rights advocates located thousands of miles apart. 

Here are a few testimonials demonstrating the range of healing and connection that participants experience in our workshops.

### Third workshop

> I really appreciated the workshop, as well as the lovely folks who attended. It's great to see such a diverse group of minds come together to create! The environment was very kind and supportive, and the encouragement and gratitude were sincere. I loved the free-write exercises, as well as the focus on "I" statements and feelings in feedback. Hy is an excellent facilitator, and did a great job of keeping everyone kind, focused, and on track. I'm deeply grateful to have been included - and excited to have finally broken through a creative block!

> It was a great workshop!  Met some wonderful people and really enjoyed sinking into the present moment, sometimes hard to look at all the pain but Hy created a welcoming and kind healing environment to process difficult things

### Fifth workshop

> I like this! I still have wounds that have not healed, but in this environment I can get a stitch here and a stitch there.

### Sixth workshop

> Definitely was a great date night for us.

> It really was a perfect date night in my opinion.
