For our second WRITE ON! workshop, 14 persons gathered in the back event space of [Hostel Buffalo-Niagara](https://www.hostelbuffalo.com). The Hostel holds a strong sense of community, from its murals to its communal kitchen to its front art gallery.

In this gloriously decorated room of this beautiful Buffalo institution, we entered as strangers and found a way to write from our hearts and our bodies, and to feel comfortable sharing with each other.

Erricka arrived early to help set up. Ian welcomed people as they arrived. Amiyah and Sam had enjoyed the first workshop, and they each brought a friend with them this time. Christine showed up with her daughter, ensuring that this gathering truly was all ages.

During the time for sharing our writing, it was an honor to witness each person's truth inspiring others.
