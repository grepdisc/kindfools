## Uniquely Human

What is the Human experience? 

it's prevailing winds<br>
knocking our moored boats

it's crashing waves<br>
taking us under

But it's also<br>
worshipping the<br>
Sun, Moon, and Stars

for thousands of years<br>
and forever and a day

We also give meaning to the trees-<br>
with such grandeur 

those trees<br>
always watching and protecting

when Light filters in<br>
through the leaves

the way we feel<br>
is immeasurable 

Holiness there in<br>
those patches

But Humans are all<br>
experts<br>
in their own experience

the Uniqueness of each of us<br>
brings power to the Universe
