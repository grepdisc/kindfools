## The Shuffle

Shuffling papers<br>
Shuffling steps<br>
Shuffling memories<br>
Shuffling Calls<br>
Shuffle shuffle shuffle<br>
The sound that's been muffled<br>
The sound through the halls<br>
Like scratching and tapping on walls<br>
Holding back showing, shedding, and sharing<br>
sad, horror stories<br>
over and over<br>
groups and meetings<br>
like poison through the ears<br>
A disaster to clean<br>
A path to clear<br>
To trample the fears<br>
Prevent recreating and enabling<br>
An endless nightmare.
