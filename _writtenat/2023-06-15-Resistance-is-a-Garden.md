## Resistance is a Garden

Injustice Anywhere<br>
Is a Threat to Justice everywhere<br>
Black Lives Matter<br>
My Body My Choice <br>
Kindness is Everything<br>
Science is Real <br>
A garden of promise<br>
Your existence is <br>
Welcome here <br>
Come as You Are <br>
Walk amongst <br>
The flowers we've planted <br>
Cottage Street is like a Fairy Tale <br>
Though it is rough <br>
Around the edges you just have to<br>
Walk around a little <br>
Find the heart shapes <br>
With your toes <br>
And remember<br>
People Live Here <br>
Gentrification<br>
Will not steal the soul of a place <br>
Or the Acknowledgment of unceded Land<br>
Money cannot buy the heart <br>
Of the Barrio <br>
Or the way my neighbors blast <br>
Boleros under the <br>
MexicanAmericanPuertoRican Flags<br>
On Saturday <br>
My vecinos sending me <br>
A bagel when I'm hungry <br>
No you can't take this <br>
With paper and pen but <br>
You can love this <br>
With paper <br>
And with pen.<br>
