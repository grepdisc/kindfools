## Written at WRITE ON!

This third piece was written by Hy Carrel during Kind Fools' fifth WRITE ON! workshop.

## A Poem Is

A poem is a core<br>
of a thought,<br>
An idea, stripped of chocolate,<br>
just nougat.

A poem is feeling,<br>
Less thinking,<br>
Less a cat meowing<br>
Than one purring. 

A poem is complete.<br>
It does not deplete.

Context and explanation<br>
Are like a vacation<br>
From a job<br>
That embodies the core of us.<br>
They are nice,<br>
but for a poem,<br>
They are superfluous.<br>
