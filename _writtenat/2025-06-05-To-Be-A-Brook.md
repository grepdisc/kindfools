## Written at WRITE ON!

[Written at WRITE ON!](/writtenat/) is a series of articles written by participants during a [WRITE ON! workshop](/writeon), and shared with the community.

This was written by Hy Carrel during a WRITE ON workshop on June 3, 2025.
The staff of the Buffalo Urban Resiliency Center invited Community Canvases' Kind Fools
to facilitate WRITE ON with their Women's Empowerment Group in September 2024, May 2025
and June 2025. This piece was written on the shores of Lake Erie and in the presence
of these inspiring and wise women.

In this piece, Hy uses a metaphor to describe the type of presence we aspire to
provide for one another during Kind Fools programs.


## To Be a Brook

To listen like a rolling brook<br>
To hear with clear waters<br>
To provide a window into the abyss<br>
Such that the bottom appears close

To be a pool of depth that can hold any story<br>
Yet feel inviting for a dipped toe or an idly paddled canoe

To know that there are wild rapids upstream,<br>
And a serene lake downstream<br>
But right here, the stream moseys over moss covered stones,<br>
Homes for crayfish<br>
Cleaning the waters of debris.

Come, let your stories bathe<br>
In the cool flow of this creek.<br>
You may leave lighter and more hopeful<br>
The buoyant consistency accepts your burdens<br>
In its effortless journey toward the lake.

Fed by melting ice in the mountains<br>
Its waters are ever pure<br>
Becoming a trickle in the fall<br>
Surging forth in the thaw<br>
They swell as you pour and pour<br>
Never muddying, being present even more

The stream is here for the thirsty<br>
Nurturing plants and fish for the hungry<br>
Tempering the winter’s chill<br>
Providing relief from the summer’s heat<br>
And suckling fruit trees on either bank

Sitting and listening to the waters’ rumble<br>
One dissolves into peaceful meditation.<br>
As you share into the flowing waves<br>
Your feelings of grief and strife,<br>
May you once again taste<br>
The sweet nectar of life.
