## My Dearest Within Me

I hope to hold my dearest close to me for the rest of my life,
to get to feel her skin pressed against mine as I wake up in the morning.
To get to feel a mix of her warmth along with the beams of sunlight hitting my skin.

I wish for this skin to be fresh, to have molted away my old form in exchange
for something new. I want my insides to match my outsides,
to allow my guts to spill on the floor in a beautiful crimson red. 

I will admit, do not know if this new form with will appear to most as human.
Though I suppose the Holy Spirit I believe to hold within me cannot be defined by such mortal concept. 

But I believe in myself far enough to know that I will carve myself open,
and I will pinch and proud until I can learn the complexities of my core.
I don’t know if it will be possible to ever fully understand me,
but I am want to know enough to accept the things I cannot change,
and to find the joy in the journey of my growth. I will embrace the abyss,
and fall into the void. Maybe then I can learn to love myself.
