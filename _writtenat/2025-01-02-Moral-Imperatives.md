## Moral Imperatives

Impoverished minds<br>
Malnourished souls<br>
Imagined lack and<br>
Gated toll<br>
Sigmas and<br>
Inflated roles<br>
Left and Right<br>
Red and Blue Polls 

What happened to the Kingdom Goals? 

Where all’s for one and one for all<br>
And there’s no race, to love is al<br>
For it’s a gift, free to receive<br>
Unified fruit<br>
Of but one seed
