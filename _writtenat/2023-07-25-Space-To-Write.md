## Space to Write

And this time was different, and so it felt that way:<br>
There was nothing owed or indebted. The invitation to go deeper
inwards or to leave remained very clear.
A commitment made without words...
A message from heart to heart...<br>
"If I am to hold yours, and you, mine, then we shall do a dance."<br>

The dance of giving and receiving:<br>
Creating more space to lean into. Never a tug-of-war, or battle.
Nothing to hold onto for dear life. Instead, liberation...
from all the fears holding back the courageous flow of love.
In being held so gently, there came a warm bed to rest.
As opposed to an edge that makes the heart pinch and split in two. <br>

Pure enjoyment overcame the space that took some time to grow:<br>
The further away the walls of the heart, the more space to fill with all
the things. No need to feel confined in a space that is ever-expanding,
growing to envelope all the special ways and secret codes held
within another.<br>

And suddenly it all made sense, even if to no one else:<br>
It didn't have to... it just did... it just is.
