## Written at WRITE ON!

Written at WRITE ON! is a series of articles written by participants during a WRITE ON! workshop, and shared with the community.

This second piece was written by participant J.B. Jack Licata during Kind Fools' fifth WRITE ON! workshop.

## Where Am I?

Where am I? Why am I here?<br>
The fact I don’t belong is something I fear.<br>
High up, head in the clouds<br>
Expecting the phone to ring, the setting’s on ‘loud’.<br>
Who’s going to call me? Will it be good news?<br>
Am I going to be in trouble? Or am I just feeling the blues?
 
Not knowing what I’m doing, I feel like a mess<br>
I just want to do good things, you get the gist.<br>
Who knows if I’ll be successful, or if my plans will work<br>
But I guess I’ll be happy, as long as no one thinks I’m a jerk.
 
Do I wish I was somewhere else? Somewhere warmer than this?<br>
Or have I found the place I can finally fuel my bliss?<br>
Never knew what I was meant for, I never got my true calling.<br>
It’s hard to take a leap of faith, with my fear of falling.<br>
“Who do I believe in? Do I believe in me?”<br>
I find myself pondering, but we’ll just have to see.<br>
