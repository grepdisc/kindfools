## The Secret of the World

What is the secret of the world?<br>
“it is to be silent.” she said.<br>
Silently,<br>
just listening to this world.<br>
Silence is the secret,<br>
Being in wonderment and curiosity.  <br>
No spoken word needed, Just silence.

Today, seeing leaves of all different shapes, sizes,
and colors. Diamonds, opals, circular, triangular
and even shapes with no name.<br>
Leaves that are minuscule, medium, and large in space.<br>
Displaying every hue of color imaginable.<br>
The magentas, indigos, maroons, and mauve to name a few.<br>
The leaves appear above, through, and below the trees, the clouds,
and the universe.<br>
My feelings, thoughts, judgements; separate onto itself, upon each leaf.<br>
Every unique leaf, on its own trajectory, slowly floating down from above.<br>
Landing on a babbling brook, a crackling creek, a rambunctious river,
or on the thunderous mighty Niagara Falls.<br>
Merging into the flow of water carrying it away.

All, in silence-yet saying so much.  <br>
Words are not needed or even privileged to describe such tapestry.<br>
All in silence, so gentle, yet so powerful.  <br>
Carrying away my woes toward an abyss.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

As is the secret to the world, is the path, the journey, I take toward
silence. Toward calmness, which does not express itself, it just is.<br>
Watching, observing, gazing at the flow of this world, silence in nature,
just being true to oneself.<br>
Not any type of noise.<br>
Just being rhythmically and methodically in synch with my surroundings.<br>
At last, the gift of knowing. <br>
The Secret of the world, is Silence.<br>
No chatter needed.
