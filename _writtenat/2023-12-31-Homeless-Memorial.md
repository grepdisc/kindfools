<br>
Cold days, colder nights.<br>
Walking from warmth to warmth,<br>
Few and far between<br>
Like sunny days in Buffalo's winter.

Code Blue, City Mission<br>
A hotel room with DSS's permission.<br>
2-1-1 option 4 after 5 PM<br>
And back to DSS again<br>
Then, Coordinated Entry and SPOA<br>
RSI at the library, what an Angel!<br>
586, Holy Cross and Salvation Army<br>
Cornerstone and Little Portion Friary

Will Marcy, BestSelf and Matt Urban.<br>
Harvest House, Friends, and UB Heals,<br>
Diana Proske with NLS, what a guardian angel!

Rhonda, Mark, Sean, Heather and Claire

So many lives.<br>
So many dreams.<br>
So much harder.<br>
Then we need to make them.

There goes each of we,<br>
But for events within neither our control nor our comprehension.

Lead with love and compassion<br>
Housing is a human right!<br>
Look upon our homeless breathren<br>
Not as a sight.<br>
Look upon them as a light.<br>
A light that shines on what we might improve<br>
About our city, county, country

In our City of Good Neighbors.<br>
In this city we build up with all our labors<br>
No one should die in abject poverty.<br>
No one should die upon these streets.<br>
Accomplishing this is no small feat.<br>
But this is right.<br>
And sometime before we die,<br>
Do you think you might,<br>
Join us to try?
