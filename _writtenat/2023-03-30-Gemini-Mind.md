## I Have A Gemini Mind

The things and elements that intertwine and juxtapose<br>
Within the frame of my own mindscape,<br>
Limitless like space.<br>
Wonders and horrors.<br>
Hopes and fears.<br>
Manifested and rearranged at my own whim,<br>
In the twilight zone of my imagination.

I change the channel at will.<br>
I have my favorite channels of frequented mood and obsession.<br>
My top favorites are comedy, sci-fi, discovery, and fantasy,<br>
And the lesser known UHF stations of internal conflict and existential dread.<br>
Though I am free to surf the internal cosmos of mind and matter,<br>
I find myself glued to my own screen.<br>
Must see TV broadcast live from downtown me-ville.

Can't write this stuff, it's so crazy.<br>
But here I am, and here we are.<br>
Playing our part in our own runaway satirical epic drama comedy<br>
documentary telenovela with a bottomless box of microwave popcorn.<br>
