## I Am a Guest House

I am a guest house.<br>
I welcome feelings, experiences and thoughts into myself.<br>
I contain them and immerse myself within them.

Some of these I birthed within me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My thoughts, my emotions, my ideas.<br>
Some inspire me.<br>
Some fill me with confusion, despair and shame.<br>
My work is to relate well with what are mine.

Some of these I carry with me.<br>
These are gifts from my past:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adorations and criticisms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notions and narratives.<br>
Placed upon me by others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lovingly or aspirationally,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carelessly or ignorantly,<br>
I carry them within myself,<br>
Often unaware of how much space they occupy<br>
Or of how they filter my perceptions.<br>
These are for me to welcome,<br>
To express gratitude for,<br>
And to let go.<br>
They are not mine to hold.<br>
I may choose a few<br>
To make my own<br>
And to smile as I pass on from the rest.

And, some of these I hold for others.<br>
My guest house is here to be inhabited.<br>
In conversation, I welcome another to share their thoughts,<br>
Their dreams, and their fears with me.<br>
Together we can hold space<br>
We can feel the healing touch of air.<br>
As breath forms words,<br>
As ideas are spoken aloud,<br>
They echo harmlessly on the walls of our ears.<br>
This guest house is a temporary sanctuary.

This third group of stories and feelings,<br>
They are mine to hold gently<br>
And then to let flow away.<br>
For we must keep our home ready for new guests.
