## Freedom Ain't Free

Freedom ain't free, costs are high see<br>
Miracles are preceded by tragedy

Inward expansion, taking up space.<br>
I am the torch carrier, the standard bearer,<br>
The warrior-healer, the peasant-queen.<br>
I am the barren-mother, the peaceful-power.<br>
I walk lightly on the earth, atop the water floating.

I don't meld. I am the stark taste<br>
That stands out on your tongue<br>
Fire-spitter, soothing salve<br>
Holy & sacred, the tornado’s courage.<br>
In humility, I gently move all opposition into its place.<br>
Out of my locus,<br>
My sanctity – safe.
