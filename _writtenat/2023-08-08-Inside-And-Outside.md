## Inside & Outside

A running brook, stones untouched<br>
I search for warmth and calm<br>
Two sides of a coin, as such I question luck

Thinking, thinking, thinking<br>
As heart and brain toil and fuss<br>
A running brook, stones untouched

Doing, doing, doing<br>
Running after much discussion of us<br>
Two sides of a coin, as such I question luck

Internally, intrinsically linked<br>
Hunches, crutches, intuition, trusting the gut<br>
A running brook, stones untouched

Externally, intrinsically linked<br>
Acting, inaction, finding answers and passions<br>
Two sides of a coin, as such I question luck

I live for three, we, you, and me<br>
Searching for calm through everything <br>
A running brook, stones untouched<br>
Two sides of a coin, as such I question luck
