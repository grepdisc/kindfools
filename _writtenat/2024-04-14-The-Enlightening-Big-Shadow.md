## The Enlightening Big Shadow

Light<br>
Dark<br>
Big Shadow<br>
We fell under

Cast by a piece of Mother<br>
She lost long ago<br>
Long ago?<br>
A piece she still holds relatively close

That piece<br>
Which faithfully night-lights our nights<br>
That piece that’s always there for you<br>
But you may not often acknowledge

That piece often forgotten…<br>
Except maybe by poets, the sea and the feminine

But then, Lost Piece, not too too far<br>
You demanded the attention of the masses<br>
Even if just for a moment<br>
Not with force<br>
Not by blasting at us<br>
But rather by your ability to stand between us<br>
And that which brings life to Mother and her children

And in that moment<br>
It is possible<br>
That a shadow<br>
Actually shed light<br>
On those things often left in darkness

Birds, trees, humans<br>
You gave us these<br>
The reason we crossed the threshold<br>
Of the doorway that leads<br>
From Nothing-There to Something-There

You’re the Sun<br>
My Sun<br>
The reason<br>
Bees pass the secrets of the flowers<br>
Secrets you imbued them with upon their creation

The reason<br>
For the color at the intersection of red and blue<br>
The reason for color at all<br>
Each and every hue<br>
The reason for the serpent<br>
Who promised wisdom

You make me new each day<br>
You make the day<br>
You create each spectacle I have ever seen<br>
You are what I am in awe of

You do justice<br>
To the beauty of the beloved<br>
At your cresting

For why people congregate<br>
To celebrate<br>
The Path of the Light<br>
You encapsulate all I have come to know of love

But that forgotten piece<br>
Blocks you out for a split second<br>
And…
